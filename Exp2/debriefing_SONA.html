            <p>Thank you for your participation. Your completion code is displayed at the bottom of the page.</p>

                <dt> 1.  What is the general aim of this research? </dt>
                <dd>The experiment you participated in today is part of a larger study investigating strategies that enhance memory. One strategy examined in this research is making judgments about learning, which involves monitoring your learning by rating how well you understand a text you read. We are interested in understanding whether framing judgments of learning to highlight questions versus both questions and answers will influence your accuracy in predicting which concepts you understand.</dd> 

                <dt>2.  Is this correlational or experimental research?</dt>
                <dd>The study you participated in represents experimental research. The independent variable we manipulated was the framing of each judgment of learning.  One group made judgments of learning for material that involves rating their understanding for specific questions that were matched to content they were later tested on.  A second group made judgments of learning for material with both the questions and answers present.  The dependent variable we are interested in is the correlation between your judgments of learning and performance. We predict that making judgments of learning with both the questions and answers present will improve the accuracy of your predictions.</dd>

                <dt>3.  What topic in introductory psychology does this research illustrate?</dt>
                <dd>The current research falls within the general area of human learning and memory. For an overview of research on human memory, see Chapter 8 in Nairne's <i>Psychology: The Adaptive Mind</i> (4th Edition), Chapter 9 in Meyers' <i>Psychology</i> (8th Edition), or Chapter 9 in Gray's <i>Psychology</i> (5th Edition). Another excellent book covering current research on human memory is <i>The Seven Sins of Memory</i>, by Dan Schacter.</dd>

                <dt>4.  Where can I learn more about this type of research?</dt>
                <dd>> If you are interested in learning more about our research you can read all of our published studies here http://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/publications/. You can also read the following book to learn more about judgments of learning:  Dunlosky, J., & Metcalfe, J. (2008). Metacognition. Sage Publications.  Here are two other relevant references:<dd>

                        <dt>5.  Who is conducting this research?</dt>
                        <dd>This research is being conducted by members of the Cognition and Learning Laboratory at Purdue University, under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey D. Karpicke, an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychological Sciences. You may contact the laboratory via email at <a href="mailto:learninglab@purdue.edu" target="_top">learninglab@purdue.edu</a>, and you can learn more about our research at our website, <a href="http://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/">http://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/</a>.</dd>

                        <dd>A lot of research in psychology depends on the participation of individuals like you. We are very grateful for your help. Thank you very much for participating.</dd>
