A geologic process is a natural process that occurs in or on Earth and that shapes Earthâ€™s features, including volcanic activity; the movement of tectonic plates; the formation of sedimentary layers of sand and mud; and the folding of those layers until, deep in the Earth, they are exposed to high pressures and temperatures.</p>"

    "text": "<p>A mineral is an inorganic substance, which usually means it was not made by living organisms. Organic substances are all the carbon-based compounds made by living creatures, including proteins, carbohydrates, and oils. This definition includes fossil fuels such as coal and oil, which were originally made by living organisms millions of years ago. Everything else is considered inorganic. In a few exceptional cases, living organisms produce inorganic materials, such as the calcium carbonate shells of marine organisms.</p>"

    "title": "Crystalline Solids",
    "text": "<p>Minerals are crystalline solids. Therefore, natural inorganic substances that are liquids are not minerals. For example, liquid water is inorganic, but it is not a mineral. Even some solids may not be crystalline. A crystal is a solid in which the atoms are arranged in a regular, repeating pattern. For example, in table salt, sodium ions bond with chloride ions to form halite crystals.  The ions sodium and chloride are arranged in table salt in an alternating repeating pattern across three dimensions. The pattern of atoms in different samples of the same mineral is the same. Think about all of the grains of salt that are in a salt shaker. The atoms are arranged in the same way in every piece of salt.</p>"

    "title": "Elements",
    "text": "<p>All minerals have a specific chemical composition. Minerals are either pure elements or chemical compounds. An element is a substance in which all of the atoms have the same number of protons. Protons are the positive particles in the center of every atom, the nucleus. You cannot change an element into another element by chemical means because the number of protons does not change. Silver, sodium, silicon, and oxygen are a few of the elements found in minerals. A few minerals are made of only one kind of element. The mineral silver is a pure element because it is made up of only silver atoms.</p>"

    "title": "Compounds",
    "text": "<p>Most minerals, such as halite and quartz, are made up of chemical compounds. A chemical compound is a substance in which the atoms of two or more elements bond together. The elements in a chemical compound are in a certain ratio. Minerals that are not pure elements are made of compounds. For example, the mineral quartz is made of the compound silicon dioxide. This compound has one atom of the element silicon for every two atoms of the element oxygen. When a mineral has a different chemical formula, it is a different mineral. For example, the mineral hematite has two iron atoms for every three oxygen atoms, while the mineral magnetite has three iron atoms for every four oxygen atoms. Many minerals contain more complex chemical compounds that are made of several elements. However, even the elements in more complicated compounds occur in certain ratios.</p>"
